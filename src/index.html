    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>My first passion in life is creating beautiful music.
      I play an array of instruments, and have a vast understanding of music theory.
      I also enjoy reading, and keeping up on current events. I just recently dove into
      coding. My skills have been growing rapidly. I currently attend DevMountain, and
      have been learning the following languages in depth.
